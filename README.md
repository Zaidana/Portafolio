# Background History

I began learning about Unity and video game development in 2019, but it became more serious in 2023 when I had the opportunity 
to be part of Generation's Bootcamp, which was designed and conducted in collaboration with Unity itself. At the same time, I 
was studying Unity Development at Utel University to deepen my knowledge of game development.

In the current year, I have individually developed three demos for three individual game ideas and assisted in developing two games 
along with a group of talented individuals.

# Games

## Far Far Away Kitty

The first actual game that I created on my own was 'Far Far Away Kitty,' an infinite runner about a cat. The main objective is to 
achieve the highest number of points and run for the longest time. This game was one of the tasks for the Utel Bootcamp. All the code of the 
game was written by me and the art was found in free assets online. 

You can find the repository for the game here: https://github.com/Zaidana/Far-Far-Away-Kitty.git

## Paw Paw Away

Once I felt more confident in my abilities and knowledge of C#, I began to create mechanis and scripts. I then had the idea for a second
game, wich is about a dog trying to return home in a world where humans cannot go outside due to an unknown virus, this is how the first
demo version of "Paw Paw Away" was developed.
