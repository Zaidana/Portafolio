*Background History

I began learning about Unity and video game development in 2019, but it became more serious in 2023 when I had the opportunity 
to be part of Generation's Bootcamp, which was designed and conducted in collaboration with Unity itself. At the same time, I 
was studying Unity Development at Utel University to deepen my knowledge of game development.

In the current year, I have individually developed three demos for three individual game ideas and assisted in developing two games 
along with a group of talented individuals.

The first actual game that I created on my own was 'Far Far Away Kitty,' an infinite runner about a cat. The main objective is to 
achieve the highest number of points and run for the longest time. This game was one of the tasks for the Utel Bootcamp.
