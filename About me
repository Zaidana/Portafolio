Hello World! 

I'm a 3d generalist and a junior game developer born and raised in Colombia. I remember the first time I got a console that I could called mine, my mom gave my sister 
and I a PS1 and I remember Spiro being one of those first games I played. 
It was funny because at that time, we had the console but we didn't had any memory cards, so I used to hide the play so my mom wouldn't noticed that I didn't 
turned off so I could finished the game, spoiler alert, I never did, my mom always turned off in the morning, but this developed something in me, a passion about 
seeing worlds that were impossible in my regular life, connecting with characters in all levels by being in my livingroom. 

This passion has guiden my life, always looking to learn new things about digital art and game development, seeking to use all my knowledge and passion to serve and 
create dreams that others have imagine. 

As this day, I work mainly as a 3D animator, but I'm in love with 2D animation and game development, using different softwares as Maya, Blender, Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects
for art and animation, and Unity (C#) for game development.
